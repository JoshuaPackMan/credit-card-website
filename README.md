# credit-card-website

A website to get information about and keep track of your credit card rewards.

- This is done solely by card types, e.g. Chase Sapphire or Bank of America. No credit card numbers needed!

The website is live at https://ymfcardrewards.com/

- The frontend is React, the backend is Express

This was deployed using an Ubuntu DigitalOcean Droplet. This involved:

- configuring Nginx, setting up the default Ubuntu firewall, and obtaining an SSL certificate
